/*
You are given N activities, each having a start time and a finish time. 
A single person (or machine) can perform only one activity at a time. 
Two activities are said to be compatible if the start time of one activity
is greater than or equal to the finish time of the other activity. 
Write a program using greedy strategy to select the maximum number of non-
overlapping activities that can be performed by the person.
E.g.:
Input:
N = 6
start = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]
finish = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
Output:
Maximum number of activities = 4
Selected activities: (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 7), (8, 9)
